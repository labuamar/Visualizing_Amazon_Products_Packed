# Visualizing_Amazon_Products_Packed
This project attempts to visualize the best packing of purchased items. To do this, the project is broken up into several steps:
  1. Scraping products, product dimensions, and product weights from the Amazon website.
  2. Cleaning of the data.
  3. Customizing the bin packing algorithm for our needs.
  4. Building a purchase mechanism that uses packing.
  5. Visualizing items packed.
